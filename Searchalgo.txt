Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize
• Create a dynamic array pointer students (initially NULL).
• Initialize variable size = 0 (to track the number of students).
Step 3: Display Menu
• Show menu options repeatedly until the user chooses to exit:
1. Add Student
2. Linear Search by ID
3. Binary Search by ID
4. Exit
Step 4: Add Student
1. Reallocate memory for students to hold one more record.
2. If memory allocation fails → display error and terminate.
3. Input:
o Student ID
o Student Name
o Student CGPA
4. Store entered details in the newly allocated memory.
5. Increment size by 1.
Step 5: Linear Search (Search by ID)
1. Input searchID.

2. Traverse student records from index 0 to size-1.
3. If any student’s id == searchID:
o Display student details.
o Exit search.
4. If no match found → Display "Student not found (Linear Search)."
Step 6: Binary Search (Search by ID)
1. Input searchID.
2. Sort the array students by id using qsort.
3. Initialize: low = 0, high = size - 1.
4. Repeat until low > high:
o Find middle index mid = (low + high) / 2.
o If students[mid].id == searchID:
▪ Display student details.
▪ Exit search.
o Else if students[mid].id < searchID: set low = mid + 1.
o Else set high = mid - 1.
5. If no match found → Display "Student not found (Binary Search)."
Step 7: Exit
• If user selects option 4, display "Exiting program..."
• Free allocated memory using free(students).
• Terminate program.
