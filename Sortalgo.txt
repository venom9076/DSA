Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize
• Create a pointer students = nullptr.
• Set count = 0.
• Declare variable choice for menu selection.
Step 3: Display Menu
Repeat until the user selects Exit (choice = 6):
1. Add Student
2. Display Students
3. Sort by Name (Bubble Sort)
4. Sort by CGPA Ascending (Selection Sort)
5. Sort by CGPA Descending (Selection Sort)
6. Exit
Step 4: Add Student
1. Create a new array temp of size count + 1.
2. Copy all existing students from students into temp.
3. Input new student details:
o Student ID
o Student Name
o Student CGPA
4. Store new student in temp[count].
5. Delete old array students.
6. Update students = temp.

7. Increment count.
Step 5: Display Students
• Print details of all students (id, name, cgpa) from index 0 to count-1.
Step 6: Bubble Sort by Name
1. Repeat for each pass i = 0 to count-2:
o Compare adjacent names (students[j] and students[j+1]) using strcmp.
o If name[j] > name[j+1], swap them.
2. Continue until all names are sorted alphabetically.
Step 7: Selection Sort by CGPA
1. For each index i = 0 to count-2:
o Set idx = i.
o Compare CGPA with remaining students (j = i+1 to count-1).
o If sorting ascending → choose smallest CGPA.
o If sorting descending → choose largest CGPA.
o Swap students[i] and students[idx].

Step 8: Exit
• If user chooses option 6:
o Print "Exiting...".
o Free memory (delete[] students).
o End program.
