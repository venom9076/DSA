Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize Graph
1. Input number of vertices V.
2. Create a V x V adjacency matrix graph to store edge weights.
o graph[i][j] = weight of edge between vertex i and j.
o graph[i][j] = 0 if no edge exists.
Step 3: Initialize Prim’s Algorithm
1. Create arrays:
o key[]: Stores minimum weight to include vertex in MST. Initialize all to ∞ (or
sys.maxsize).
o parent[]: Stores parent of each vertex in MST. Initialize all to None.
o mstSet[]: Boolean array to track vertices included in MST. Initialize all to False.
2. Set key[0] = 0 (start from vertex 0).
3. Set parent[0] = -1 (starting vertex has no parent).
Step 4: Construct MST
1. Repeat V times (for all vertices):
a. Find vertex u with minimum key[u] that is not yet in MST (mstSet[u] = False).
b. Include u in MST: mstSet[u] = True.
c. For all vertices v adjacent to u:
o If graph[u][v] > 0 and v not in MST and graph[u][v] < key[v]:
▪ Update key[v] = graph[u][v]
▪ Update parent[v] = u

Step 5: Print MST
1. For each vertex i from 1 to V-1:
o Print edge: parent[i] -- i == graph[i][parent[i]]

o Accumulate total cost: total_cost += graph[i][parent[i]]
2. Print Minimum Spanning Tree Cost.
