Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize Graph
1. Create a Graph class with:
o V = number of vertices
o graph = empty list to store edges in the form [u, v, w]
2. Add edges to the graph using add_edge(u, v, w).
Step 3: Prepare for MST
1. Initialize result = [] to store MST edges.
2. Sort all edges in graph in ascending order of weight.
3. Create two lists for disjoint set (Union-Find):
o parent[i] = i for all vertices
o rank[i] = 0 for all vertices
Step 4: Kruskal’s Algorithm Main Loop
1. Initialize counters:
o i = 0 → index for sorted edges
o e = 0 → count of edges included in MST
2. While e < V-1 (MST has exactly V-1 edges):
1. Pick edge graph[i] = [u, v, w]
2. Increment i by 1
3. Find roots of u and v using find() (with path compression):

▪ If find(u) != find(v) → no cycle
▪ Add edge [u, v, w] to result
▪ Increment e by 1
▪ Union the sets of u and v using union() (by rank)
▪ Else → discard edge (would form a cycle)

Step 5: Display MST
1. Print all edges in result in the format: u -- v == w
2. Compute total cost by summing the weights of edges in MST
3. Print total MST cost
Step 6: End
Step 7: Supporting Functions
• find(parent, i) → returns root of vertex i (with path compression)
• union(parent, rank, x, y) → joins sets of x and y using rank to minimize tree height
